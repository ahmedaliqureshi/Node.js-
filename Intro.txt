Intro to node.js 

1) In 2009 the software engineer known as ryan dajl from the US created node.js

2) JS was only used in browsers. 

3) servers were buil usign php, puthon or java 

4) each request on server would create a new thread,consuming memory and slowing things down under heavy load. 

5) rayan found this ineffecient especially after seeing how web browsers handled asynchronous events 

6) he wanted the same non blocking behviour on the server, that how node.js was born to bring JS to the backend but in a faster and more scalable way 

The core idea event driven and non blocking i/o 

The node.js used the follwoing to make the node.js 

1) google V8 engine (the same engine that powers chrome)

2) ibuv (a c library for asynchronous i?O)

this combinations allowed node.js to 

1) handled many requests at once using a single thread 

2) avoid blocking while waiting for tasks like file reading or database queries

3) node.js introduced a single threaded, event driven architectrue that made servers lightweight and fast

Early stages

1) node.js was relaeased at JSCong EU conference in 2009
2) Node package manager (npm) was introdueced the game changer, developers could easily install and share resusable packages in 2010 
3)companies like linkedin and uber started using node.js for their backends due to it's speed and scalability

eg:- likedln moved from ruby on rails to node.js and saw their servers 
handle 10x more traffic with fewer machines 

winter of node.js 

1) node.js rapidly became the go to choice for building 
/ api 
/real time applications 
/caommand line tools 
/developers utilites 

big companies 
netflix for streaming 
payapl for faster apis 
ebay, wlamart and NASA adopted node.js in production 

however, around 2014, there was community tension- development was slow and contributors were frustrated

Todays ecosystem 

1) the node.js ecosystem is massive 

/ over 2 million packages on npm 
/ used by 90% of modern web developers
/ foundation for frameworkds like express.js, fastify and adonisjs 
it's no longer "just  JS on the server"
it's the backbone of the modern web, connecting api, microservices and tools

time line 

year                events          
2009                 created node.js 
2010                 npm is lauched 
2011                 likedin and uber shifted 
2014                 io.js fork due to governance issues 
2015                 io.js merges back-> nodes.js foundation formed 
2017                 async/await, ES modules and mahor improvement
2020s                node.js becomes a global standard for web servers
