 Node.js Setup Guide
Welcome to this quick and beginner-friendly guide on setting up Node.js on your system!
Whether you're starting your first JavaScript project or preparing for backend development — this guide has you covered. ⚡

 What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside your browser — perfect for building fast, scalable network applications like servers, APIs, or even bots! 

Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have:

A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux 
Internet connection 
Basic knowledge of using the terminal / command prompt 
Step 1: Download & Install Node.js
Go to the official website:
 https://nodejs.org

You’ll see two versions:

LTS (Recommended for most users) 
Current (Latest features, may be unstable) 
Choose LTS for stability.

Download the installer and run it.

During installation:

Keep all default settings 
Make sure the “Add to PATH” option is checked 
Once installation is complete, restart your terminal or command prompt.

Step 2: Verify Installation
To make sure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly, run these commands:

 This shows the Node.js version (example: v20.10.1)

npm -v

 This shows the npm version (example: 10.2.3)

If both return version numbers — congratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully installed Node.js on your machine.

 Step 3: Create Your First Node Project

Open your terminal or VS Code.

Create a new folder:

 bash
  
mkdir my-first-node-app
cd my-first-node-app


Initialize your project:

npm init -y


This creates a package.json file.

Create a test file:

echo "console.log('Hello from Node.js!');" > index.js


Run it:

node index.js


 You should see:

Hello from Node.js!
 
 Bonus Tips

Use VS Code for best experience: https://code.visualstudio.com

 bash

To check Node.js version , use the Node Version Manager (nvm)

Keep npm packages up to date with:

npm update -g

node -v
